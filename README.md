# üìÄ Levari

Levari is a terminal-based, non-stateful music player that allows users to experience their music library in a new way. The application emulates the experience of a physical vinyl player. Your collection is always shuffled, like your record shelf, helping you discover hidden gems in your library. There are no playlists or queues; you must manually switch songs or listen to an entire album at once, as it was meant to be listened to.

## Usage

Run the script by passing it your music library path as an argument. It will be processed recursively:

```bash
nix run github:tupakkatapa/levari -- <path>
```
